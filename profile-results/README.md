The `.nsys-rep` files can be viewed with Nvidia Nsight Systems.

The `-cpu` and `-gpu` suffix on the filenames indicates whether boundary conditions are computed on CPU or GPU, and the `-gridX` suffix indicates the side length of the mesh. For example, `bte2dgpu-cpu-grid100` means the bte2dgpu Finch example, with boundary conditions computed on CPU, and with a 100x100 mesh.
